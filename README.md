# BombPatcher
An application to do something I've always wanted to do: patch the System file to customize the Mac OS Classic "Sorry, a system error occurred" bomb dialog.

 *  **Always make a backup copy of the file you are patching.** We will not be held responsible if something goes wrong.
 *  **Do not patch the active System file.** If possible, use a different startup disk to do the patching, and patch a copy instead.
 *  There is a chance of "de-blessing" the System Folder. If this happens, make another copy of the original System file and try patching again.
 *  For System 7 and later, you may have to patch the System Enabler as well as the System file. The same warnings and caveats apply!
